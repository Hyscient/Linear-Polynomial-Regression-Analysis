# Linear-Polynomial-Regression-Analysis
# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project aims to predict wine quality ratings based on various features using regression modeling techniques. The dataset contains information about different wines, including features like price, number of reviews, body, and acidity. We explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build and evaluate different regression models, and analyze feature importances.

## Known Issues

- Overfitting: Overfitting is a concern when experimenting with various regression models and hyperparameters. While aiming for high performance on the training data, there's a risk that the models may not generalize well to new, unseen data. Careful attention to regularization techniques and cross-validation is necessary to prevent overfitting and ensure robust model performance.
  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: While you've performed hyperparameter tuning for some models, there's an ongoing challenge in finding the optimal set of hyperparameters. Grid search can be computationally expensive, and alternative methods like RandomizedSearchCV or Bayesian optimization could be explored.
  
- Data Size and Diversity: The predictive power of the models relies heavily on the size and diversity of the dataset. Limited data size or lack of diversity might hinder the models from generalizing effectively. Exploring opportunities to expand the dataset, potentially through external sources, is essential to address this limitation.
